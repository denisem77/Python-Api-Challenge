-Inside the folder you just created, add the files called api_keys.py, WeatherPy.ipynb, and VacationPy.ipynb 
- Add a .gitignore File

This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

Part 1: WeatherPy
Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship

Part 2: VacationPy
-Use skills to plan future vacations using GeoApify.
